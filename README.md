# Free Agent Task

Task: classify bank transactions using their natural language descriptions.

I have used BERT to implement a model capable of classifying finance transaction records using their text descriptions as input. The model achieves an accuracy of 85.72%.

Code has been published here but the bank transactions data has been withheld.
